This homework expands on the concepts and techniques introduced in the previous assignment. The objective is to integrate serial inputs from an Arduino device to dynamically control visual elements on a canvas. Specifically, the implementation uses a button and a potentiometer to interactively influence a pyramid-like figure displayed on the canvas.

The button input is designed to alter the colors of the individual shapes that compose the figure. Each press cycles through a set of predefined colors, creating a visually engaging and interactive experience. This highlights the ability to process and respond to digital inputs in real-time.

Additionally, the potentiometer input is used to animate the figure. By introducing an analog control mechanism, the project demonstrates how continuous input values can be mapped to graphical properties. The smooth resizing of the figure showcases how analog sensor data can be effectively utilized to create dynamic and visually appealing changes.
